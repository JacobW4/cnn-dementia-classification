# CNN for Early Dementia Detection

A convolutional neural network model designed to classify brain MRI scans and distinguish between very mild dementia patients and healthy individuals using deep learning.

## Project Overview

This project implements a binary classification CNN to identify patients with very mild dementia from cognitively healthy individuals. 
Early detection of mild cognitive impairment is critical for timely intervention and treatment planning.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Alzheimer's Disease Augmented MRI Dataset** available on Kaggle.
